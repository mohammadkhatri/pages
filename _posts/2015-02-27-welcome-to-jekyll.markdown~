You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight java %}
gvChannels.setOnItemClickListener(new OnItemClickListener() {
@Override
public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> parent, View view,
int position, long id) {
Channel channel = adptr.getItem(position);
Constants.CURRENT_PLAYING_CHANNEL = Constants.CHANNELS
.get(position);
// TODO Auto-generated method stub
Fragment mFragment = new Video_Player_Fragment();
Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
bundle.putString("URL", channel.url);
mFragment.setArguments(bundle);
getActivity().getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction()
.replace(R.id.container, mFragment)
.addToBackStack("VIDEO_FRAGMENT").commit();
}
});
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
